# iqp-manim-videos
Here I will have my manim animations coded, along with commonly used utils like scene transitions and objects. This will give me a common design language

To render a scene/video, try this command
```
python -m manim -pqh "/path/to/py-file" SceneName --media_dir "./directory/of/py-file/media"
```
